# Neutron Reflectivity Reference Data Sets

This data set represents a published study of the determination of a thin-film structure using Neutron Reflectivity: *ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces* 2019, 11, 14, 13803\u201313811 (https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b02700). The raw data is available at https://data.isis.stfc.ac.uk/doi/INVESTIGATION/84794745/. The raw data nexus files, as well as the [original reduced data](https://github.com/DAaaS-reference-data/Reflectivity/blob/Runs_46992_46993_46994_polymer_on_Si.csv) (in .csv format) are both in the data_files folder - this directory includes a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/alexhroom/Reflectivity/blob/main/OFFSPEC_runs_46992-4/Reflectometry_reduction.ipynb) which explains the scripts used to go from the former to the latter.
