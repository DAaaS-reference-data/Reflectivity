# Neutron Reflectivity Reference Data Set: OFFSPEC

This data set represents a published study of the determination of a thin-film structure using Neutron Reflectivity: *ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces* 2019, 11, 14, 13803â€“13811 (https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b02700). The raw data is available at https://data.isis.stfc.ac.uk/doi/INVESTIGATION/84794745/. The raw data nexus files, as well as the original reduced data (in .csv format) are both in ../OFFSPEC_runs_46992-4/data_files/ - this directory includes a Jupyter notebook which explains the scripts used to go from the former to the latter.
