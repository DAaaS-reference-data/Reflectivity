# Neutron Reflectivity Reference Data Sets

This repository contains two Neutron Reflectivity data sets taken on the [INTER](https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/inter.aspx) and [OFFSPEC](https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/offspec.aspx) instruments at the [ISIS Neutron and Muon Source](https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/) (UK). The [INTER data set](https://github.com/DAaaS-reference-data/Reflectivity/tree/main/INTER_RoundRobin_Sample) was part of a wider initiative to compare neutron reflectometers world-wide by measuring a round-robin sample of a silicon wafer with a single, unknown layer on top.  The [OFFSPEC data set](https://github.com/DAaaS-reference-data/Reflectivity/tree/main/OFFSPEC_runs_46992-4) represents a published study of the determination of a thin-film structure using Neutron Reflectivity: *ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces* 2019, 11, 14, 13803â€“13811 (https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b02700). The purpose of these data sets is to act as reference data sets to test and validate Data Analysis as a Service (DAaaS) platforms, for example as part of the [EU ExPaNDS project](https://expands.eu/).
